 Task Manager Application

###  Description

The **Task Manager Application** is a console-based Python program that allows users to manage daily tasks efficiently. Users can add, view, update, and delete tasks using a text-based menu. All tasks are stored in a JSON file so that data persists even after the program is closed.

This project demonstrates core Python concepts such as **Object-Oriented Programming, file handling, modular design, input validation, and error handling**.
